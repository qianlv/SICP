; Consider the change-counting program of
; Section 1.2.2. It would be nice to be able to easily change the
; currency used by the program, so that we could compute
; the number of ways to change a British pound, for example.
; As the program is wriî€¼en, the knowledge of the currency is
; distributed partly into the procedure first-denomination
; and partly into the procedure count-change (which knows
; that there are five kinds of U.S. coins). It would be nicer
; to be able to supply a list of coins to be used for making
; change.
; We want to rewrite the procedure cc so that its second ar-
; gument is a list of the values of the coins to use rather than
; an integer specifying which coins to use. We could then
; have lists that defined each kind of currency:
;
; (define us-coins (list 50 25 10 5 1))
; (define uk-coins (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
;
; We could then call cc as follows:
;
; (cc 100 us-coins)
;
; To do this will require changing the program cc somewhat.
; It will still have the same form, but it will access its second
; argument differently, as follows:

(define (cc amount coin-values)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (no-more? coin-values)) 0)
        (else
          (+ (cc amount
                 (except-first-denomination
                   coin-values))
             (cc (- amount
                    (first-denomination
                      coin-values))
                 coin-values)))))

; Define the procedures first-denomination, except-first-
; denomination, and no-more? in terms of primitive oper-
; ations on list structures. Does the order of the list coin-
; values affect the answer produced by cc? Why or why not?


(define (first-denomination coin-values)
  (car coin-values))

(define (except-first-denomination coin-values)
  (cdr coin-values))

(define (no-more? coin-values)
  (null? coin-values))


(define us-coins (list 50 25 10 5 1))
(define uk-coins (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
(cc 100 us-coins)
(cc 100 (list 1 5 10 25 50))
