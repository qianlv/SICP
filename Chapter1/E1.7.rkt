; The good-enough? test used in computing
; square roots will not be very effective for finding the square
; roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers, arith-
; metic operations are almost always performed with lim-
; ited precision. ÓÅâis makes our test inadequate for very large
; numbers. Explain these statements, with examples showing
; how the test fails for small and large numbers. An alterna-
; tive strategy for implementing good-enough? is to watch
; how guess changes from one iteration to the next and to
; stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess.
; Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end
; test. Does this work better for small and large numbers?
