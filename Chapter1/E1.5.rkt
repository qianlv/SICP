#lang sicp

;  Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine
; whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-
; order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the
; following two procedures:

(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))

; Then he evaluates the expression

(test 0 (p))

; What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that
; uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he
; observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation?
; Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation
; rule for the special form if is the same whether the in-
; terpreter is using normal or applicative order: ÓÅâe predi-
; cate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines
; whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative ex-
; pression.) 

; Answer:
; 1. normal-order
; (test 0 (p))
; (if (= x 0) 0 (p))
; 0
; 2. applicative-order
; (test 0 (p))
; (test 0 (p))
; ... evaluation (p) forever
